# a3-dynamic-tactics
A dynamic tactical-level mission designed for flexibility and configurability

## What is this?
Recently I saw a thread in r/arma about an Arma 2 mission called Flashpoint. I'd never heard of this before, and so looking at its result was quite astounding. It was enough to get me thinking about doing something similar in Arma 3. This is (will) be that result.

## How does it work?
The goal is to have a random mission generator, designed to create a conflict in a random area, with a random scenario, random force strengths, and random player roles. However, any and all of these can be configured easily before generation.

## Anything else?
I probably won't finish this. I'll declare the project dead if I decide it is, and until then consider it under development, no matter how unlikely that may seem.
